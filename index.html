		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hello, I'm Naseha, a college student pursuing a degree in Biochemistry in NYC. <br>
		I enjoy immersing myself in new projects in digital marketing and research opportunities to further my learning experiences in science. With both, I wish to provide what I have learned over the years to various audiences, bridging the gap between science and society.</p>
